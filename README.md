# Space Shooter Game
A classic Space Shooter game built as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course project during my 2nd semester at university.
This project uses C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics, sound, and window handling.

# Gameplay Overview
- Control a spaceship and shoot incoming enemies.
- Avoid enemy collisions to survive.
- Score points by destroying enemies.

# Requirements
- Ubuntu (or any Linux distro)
- g++ compiler
- SFML library

# Run on Terminal
- cd assets
- sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev (Install SFML)
- g++ main.cpp -o game -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio
- ./game

# Learning Outcome
This project helped me practice:
- OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation
- Basic game loop structure
- Event handling with SFML
- Resource management (textures, sounds, fonts)
